The [Leda Incubator project](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-leda-incubator) is a place for new software-defined-vehicle related software components which are in incubation state.

The goal of the Eclipse Leda Incubator is to foster collaboration in the Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) ecosystem, and hopefully results in work proceeding to contribution by their original authors into upstream projects. The Eclipse Leda Incubator would not make any releases itself.

The project hosts software-defined vehicle components which are fitting into the general Eclipse Leda scope, but do not fit to either being part of Leda itself, which should be upstreamed into other projects in the future, or which are still highly experimental and should not be considered for any kind of production use.
