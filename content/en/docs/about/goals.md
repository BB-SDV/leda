The project aims to provide **an integration point for Open Source components for the Software Defined Vehicle**. For vehicle software systems, there are a lot of requirements to consider. Some of these requirements are taken into account for Leda's quickstart setups, thereas some other requirements can only be met once in a production environment and by customizing the target device image.

The following document will list some of these requirements and give an explanation on why they are met in the Leda quickstart distribution.

## Overview

- Provide an example operating system and configuration for constrained in-vehicle devices
- Integrate software-defined-vehicle Open Source components to showcase the available features and their state of maturity
- Demonstrate the use and interaction of open protocols and specifications, such as
  - the specifications from the [The Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance (COVESA)](https://www.covesa.global/)
  - OpenTelemetry specs and components
  - Eclipse IoT related specifications for software rollouts and digital twin representations
